### ‚ùå Railway Production
```
Error: Connection timeout

```

## Root Cause

**Railway is blocking outbound SMTP connections on ports 465 and 587.**

This is a network/firewall restriction by Railway to prevent spam. Many cloud platforms (Heroku, Railway, Vercel) block SMTP ports by default.

## Solutions

### Option 1: ‚≠ê Use SendGrid (RECOMMENDED)
SendGrid uses HTTP API instead of SMTP, which Railway doesn't block.

**Steps:**
1. Sign up at https://sendgrid.com (free tier: 100 emails/day)
2. Get API key
3. Install: `npm install @sendgrid/mail`
4. Set Railway env: `SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_key`

### Option 2: Use Mailgun
Similar to SendGrid, uses HTTP API.

**Steps:**
1. Sign up at https://mailgun.com (free tier: 5,000 emails/month)
2. Get API key
3. Install: `npm install mailgun.js form-data`
4. Set Railway env: `MAILGUN_API_KEY=your_key`

### Option 3: Use Nodemailer with SendGrid SMTP
SendGrid provides SMTP relay that might work:

```
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=apikey
EMAIL_PASS=your_sendgrid_api_key
```

### Option 4: Contact Railway Support
Ask Railway to whitelist SMTP ports for your project (unlikely to work).

### Option 5: Use Railway's Email Service
Check if Railway offers an email service integration.

## Recommended: Implement SendGrid
