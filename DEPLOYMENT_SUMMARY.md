## üîë Critical Configuration Points

### Backend Environment Variables (Railway)

**Must Configure**:
```env
# Database - From Railway MySQL service
DB_HOST=xxx.railway.app
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=xxx
DB_NAME=railway
DB_PORT=3306

# JWT Secret - Generate new one!
JWT_SECRET=GENERATE_NEW_SECRET

# Frontend URL - After Vercel deployment
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app

# PayMongo - Use LIVE keys for production
PAYMONGO_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_live_xxx
PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxx

# Webhook - After Railway deployment
WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/webhooks/paymongo
PAYMONGO_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsk_xxx

# Email - Your Gmail credentials
EMAIL_USER=barangaybula45@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=nqagxakkhjxpisgl
```

### Frontend Environment Variables (Vercel)

**Must Configure**:
```env
# Backend API - After Railway deployment
VUE_APP_API_URL=https://your-railway-app.up.railway.app/api

## üö® Important Notes

### 1. Hardcoded URLs - RESOLVED ‚úÖ
All hardcoded localhost URLs have been replaced with environment variables:
- ‚úÖ Frontend API calls use `VUE_APP_API_URL`
- ‚úÖ Backend CORS uses `FRONTEND_URL`
- ‚úÖ PayMongo webhook uses `WEBHOOK_URL`

### 2. File Uploads - IMPORTANT ‚ö†Ô∏è
Railway uses **ephemeral filesystem**:
- Uploaded files will be lost on restart
- For production, consider cloud storage:
  - AWS S3
  - Cloudinary
  - Google Cloud Storage
  - Railway Volumes (persistent storage)

### 3. Database - PERSISTENT ‚úÖ
- Railway MySQL is persistent
- Data won't be lost on restart
- Set up regular backups

### 4. PayMongo - CRITICAL üî¥
- **Must use LIVE keys** for production
- **Must configure webhook** with production URL
- **Cannot use localhost** - webhook needs public URL
- Test thoroughly before going live

### 5. Environment Variables - SECURITY üîê
- Never commit `.env` files to Git
- Use strong, unique secrets
- Generate new JWT_SECRET for production
- Rotate secrets periodically
