## 🔒 **SECURITY NOTES**

### **Files Kept Local Only** (Not in GitHub)
- `RAILWAY_COPY_PASTE.txt` - Contains API keys
- `RAILWAY_ENV_VARIABLES.txt` - Contains API keys
- `RAILWAY_SETUP_NOW.md` - Contains API keys
- `create_webhook_production.js` - Contains API keys

These files are in your local directory but won't be pushed to GitHub.

### **Why This is Good**
- ✅ API keys protected
- ✅ Database passwords not exposed
- ✅ JWT secrets secure
- ✅ Email passwords safe
