# üö® RAILWAY MANUAL FIX - DO THIS NOW!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

Your Railway backend logs show:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY not found in environment variables
Database connection failed: 
```

This means **Railway is NOT reading the environment variables** you set in the dashboard!

---

## üéØ **ROOT CAUSE**

Railway environment variables are **NOT being loaded** by your Node.js application. This happens when:

1. ‚ùå Variables are set in Railway dashboard BUT
2. ‚ùå `dotenv.config()` in `server.js` is looking for a `.env` file
3. ‚ùå Railway doesn't automatically inject variables into `process.env` for all deployment methods

---

## ‚úÖ **THE FIX - 3 STEPS**

### **STEP 1: Verify Variables Are Set in Railway**

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard:** https://railway.app/dashboard
2. **Click your backend service**
3. **Click "Variables" tab**
4. **Click "Raw Editor"**
5. **Verify you see ALL 30 lines** (scroll down to check)

**If variables are missing or have placeholders:**
- Delete all and paste the corrected config from `RAILWAY_RAW_EDITOR_PASTE.txt`
- Click "Update Variables"

---

### **STEP 2: Check Railway Deployment Method**

Railway can deploy in different ways:

#### **Option A: GitHub Repository (Most Common)**
If Railway is connected to a GitHub repo:
1. Railway pulls code from GitHub
2. Runs `npm install`
3. Runs `npm start`
4. Environment variables from Railway dashboard should be available

#### **Option B: Railway CLI**
If you deployed using Railway CLI:
1. Variables might not be synced
2. Need to use `railway variables set` command

#### **Option C: Direct Upload**
If you uploaded code directly:
1. Variables should work automatically

**To check which method:**
1. Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Your Service
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Look for "Source" section
4. It will show: "GitHub", "CLI", or "Direct"

---

### **STEP 3: Force Railway to Use Environment Variables**

The issue is that `dotenv.config()` in `server.js` line 10 is trying to load from a `.env` file, but Railway doesn't have that file.

**Railway environment variables should be automatically available in `process.env`**, but we need to ensure the code handles this correctly.

#### **Current Code (server.js line 10):**
```javascript
dotenv.config();
```

This looks for a `.env` file, which doesn't exist in Railway deployment.

#### **Solution:**
Railway environment variables are **already in `process.env`** - we don't need `dotenv.config()` in production!

But since we can't modify the code right now (no git repo), we need to **verify Railway is actually setting the variables**.

---

## üîç **DEBUGGING STEPS**

### **Step 1: Add Debug Logging**

We need to see what environment variables Railway actually has. Let's check the deployment logs more carefully.

**Look for these lines in Railway logs:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY not found in environment variables
```

This comes from `src/services/paymentFetchService.js` line 11.

**The code checks:**
```javascript
this.apiKey = process.env.PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY;

if (!this.apiKey) {
  logger.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è  PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY not found...');
}
```

This means `process.env.PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY` is **undefined** or **empty string**.

---

### **Step 2: Verify Variable Names Match EXACTLY**

Railway environment variables are **case-sensitive** and must match **exactly**.

**Check in Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Variables:**

| ‚úÖ Correct Name | ‚ùå Wrong Name |
|----------------|--------------|
| `PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY` | `PAYMONGO_SECRET` |
| `PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY` | `paymongo_secret_key` |
| `PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY` | `PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY ` (trailing space) |

**Common mistakes:**
- Extra spaces before/after variable name
- Extra spaces before/after variable value
- Wrong capitalization
- Typos in variable name

---

### **Step 3: Check for Special Characters**

If your variable values contain special characters, they might need escaping:

**Example:**
```
# ‚ùå Wrong (if password has special chars)
DB_PASSWORD=Pass@word#123

# ‚úÖ Correct (Railway handles this automatically, but check for quotes)
DB_PASSWORD=Pass@word#123
```

**Railway should handle special characters automatically**, but if you manually added quotes, remove them:

```
# ‚ùå Wrong
DB_PASSWORD="ZJkBtQfhQyuHoYnezodhXGCUQZBnYcrN"

# ‚úÖ Correct
DB_PASSWORD=ZJkBtQfhQyuHoYnezodhXGCUQZBnYcrN
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **MANUAL FIX PROCEDURE**

### **Option 1: Re-enter Variables One by One (Safest)**

Instead of using Raw Editor, add variables individually:

1. **Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Backend Service ‚Üí Variables**
2. **Click "New Variable"** (not Raw Editor)
3. **Add each variable manually:**

```
Variable Name: NODE_ENV
Variable Value: production
[Add]

Variable Name: PORT
Variable Value: 7000
[Add]

Variable Name: DB_HOST
Variable Value: caboose.proxy.rlwy.net
[Add]

Variable Name: DB_USER
Variable Value: root
[Add]

Variable Name: DB_PASSWORD
Variable Value: ZJkBtQfhQyuHoYnezodhXGCUQZBnYcrN
[Add]

Variable Name: DB_NAME
Variable Value: railway
[Add]

Variable Name: DB_PORT
Variable Value: 10954
[Add]

... (continue for all 30 variables)
```

4. **After adding ALL variables, Railway will auto-redeploy**
5. **Wait 2-3 minutes**
6. **Check logs**

---

### **Option 2: Use Railway CLI (Advanced)**

If you have Railway CLI installed:

```powershell
# Install Railway CLI (if not installed)
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link to your project
railway link

# Set variables
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
railway variables set PORT=7000
railway variables set DB_HOST=caboose.proxy.rlwy.net
railway variables set DB_USER=root
railway variables set DB_PASSWORD=ZJkBtQfhQyuHoYnezodhXGCUQZBnYcrN
railway variables set DB_NAME=railway
railway variables set DB_PORT=10954
# ... (continue for all variables)

# Trigger redeploy
railway up
```

---

### **Option 3: Check Railway Service Variables Tab**

1. **Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Backend Service**
2. **Click "Variables" tab**
3. **Look for a section called "Service Variables" vs "Shared Variables"**
4. **Make sure variables are in "Service Variables" (not shared)**

---

## üîç **VERIFICATION**

After setting variables, check Railway deployment logs for:

### **‚úÖ SUCCESS - Should See:**
```
‚úÖ All upload directories are ready!
‚ÑπÔ∏è  SMS Service initialized
‚ÑπÔ∏è  Email transporter initialized successfully
‚úÖ PayMongo service initialized successfully  <-- This line should appear!
‚úÖ Database connected successfully              <-- This line should appear!
üìä Connected to: caboose.proxy.rlwy.net:10954/railway
üéâ Database setup completed successfully
üöÄ Server is running on port 7000
```

### **‚ùå FAILURE - Currently Seeing:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY not found in environment variables  <-- Should NOT appear
‚ö†Ô∏è  PayMongo secret key not configured                      <-- Should NOT appear
Database connection failed:                                  <-- Should NOT appear
‚ùå Failed to start server:                                   <-- Should NOT appear
```

---

## üÜò **IF STILL NOT WORKING**

### **Last Resort: Create .env File in Railway**

If Railway is not injecting environment variables, we can create a `.env` file:

1. **Create a new file in your GitHub repo (if connected):**
   - File: `rhai_backend/.env.production`
   - Content: Copy from `RAILWAY_RAW_EDITOR_PASTE.txt`

2. **Update `server.js` to use production env file:**
   ```javascript
   // Load environment variables
   if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
     dotenv.config({ path: '.env.production' });
   } else {
     dotenv.config();
   }
   ```

3. **Commit and push to GitHub**
4. **Railway will auto-redeploy**

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:** This is NOT recommended because it exposes secrets in your repo!

## üìä **COMPARISON: What Should Happen**

| Step | ‚ùå Current State | ‚úÖ Expected State |
|------|-----------------|------------------|
| Railway loads env vars | Variables not loaded | Variables loaded into `process.env` |
| `process.env.PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY` | `undefined` | `sk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` |
| `process.env.DB_HOST` | `undefined` or `localhost` | `caboose.proxy.rlwy.net` |
| PayMongo service init | ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning | ‚úÖ Success |
| Database connection | ‚ùå Failed | ‚úÖ Connected |
| Server startup | ‚ùå Crashed | ‚úÖ Running |
