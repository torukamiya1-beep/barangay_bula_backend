### **STEP 2: Select Your Backend Service**

1. Look for your project (it might be called "brgybulabackend-production" or similar)
2. **Click on the backend service** (NOT the database)
3. You should see the service dashboard

---

### **STEP 3: Navigate to Variables**

1. Look at the **top navigation tabs**
2. You'll see: Overview | Deployments | **Variables** | Metrics | Settings

1. If there's any existing text in the editor, **select all** (Ctrl+A)
2. **Delete it**
3. Make sure the editor is **completely empty**

---

### **STEP 6: Copy the Environment Variables**

**COPY THIS ENTIRE BLOCK** (all 30 lines):

```

BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100

```

**HOW TO COPY**:
1. Click at the start of `NODE_ENV`
2. Hold Shift and click at the end of `OTP_LENGTH=6`
3. Press Ctrl+C to copy

---

### **STEP 7: Paste into Raw Editor**

1. Click inside the Raw Editor
2. Press **Ctrl+V** to paste
3. Make sure all 30 lines are there
4. Check that there are **no extra spaces or blank lines**

---

### **STEP 8: Save the Variables**

1. Look for a button that says **"Save"** or **"Update Variables"**
2. It's usually at the **bottom** or **top right**
3. **Click "Save"**

---

### **STEP 9: Wait for Deployment**

1. Railway will automatically start redeploying your backend
2. You'll see a notification or the page will refresh
3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for the deployment to complete

---

### **STEP 10: Check the Logs**

1. Click on the **"Deployments"** tab (top navigation)
2. Click on the **latest deployment** (should be at the top)
3. You'll see the deployment logs

**WHAT TO LOOK FOR**:

‚úÖ **SUCCESS** - You should see:
```
‚úÖ All upload directories are ready!
‚ÑπÔ∏è  SMS Service initialized
‚ÑπÔ∏è  Email transporter initialized successfully
‚úÖ Database connected successfully
üöÄ Server running on port 7000
```

‚ùå **FAILURE** - If you see:
```
Database connection failed
‚ùå Failed to start server
```
Then the environment variables weren't saved correctly. Go back to Step 5 and try again.

## üéØ **VERIFICATION**

### **Test 1: Health Check**

Open PowerShell and run:
```powershell
curl https://brgybulabackend-production.up.railway.app/health
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "database": "connected"
}
```

### **Test 2: Check Railway Dashboard**

1. Go back to Railway dashboard
2. Your backend service should show **"Running"** status (green)
3. No error messages

---

## üîß **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Problem: Can't find "Raw Editor" button**

**Solution**:
1. Make sure you're on the **Variables** tab
2. Look for a toggle or switch that says "Raw Editor" or "Bulk Edit"
3. Try clicking on "Add Variable" first, then look for "Raw Editor"

### **Problem: Variables not saving**

**Solution**:
1. Make sure you clicked "Save" or "Update Variables"
2. Check if there's a confirmation message
3. Refresh the page and check if variables are there

### **Problem: Backend still crashing after adding variables**

**Solution**:
1. Check the deployment logs for specific errors
2. Verify all 30 variables are present
3. Check for typos in variable names (they're case-sensitive!)
4. Make sure there are no extra spaces before or after the `=` sign

### **Problem: "Database connection failed"**

**Solution**:
1. Check these specific variables:
   - `DB_HOST=caboose.proxy.rlwy.net`
   - `DB_PORT=10954`
   - `DB_NAME=railway`
   - `DB_USER=root`
   - `DB_PASSWORD=ZJkBtQfhQyuHoYnezodhXGCUQZBnYcrN`
2. Make sure there are no typos
3. Make sure the password is exactly as shown (case-sensitive!)
