## üéì Technical Explanation

### Why Emails Might Go to Spam:

1. **New Sender Reputation**
   - barangaybula45@gmail.com is relatively new
   - Gmail doesn't have enough history to trust it
   - First emails often go to spam

2. **Email Content Triggers**
   - Words like "verification", "OTP", "code"
   - Can trigger spam filters initially

3. **SPF/DKIM Not Configured**
   - Your domain might not have proper email authentication
   - Gmail is more cautious with these emails

### How to Fix Long-term:

1. **Configure SPF Record**
   - Add SPF record to your domain DNS
   - Tells Gmail this sender is legitimate

2. **Configure DKIM**
   - Add DKIM signature to emails
   - Proves emails aren't tampered with

3. **Build Sender Reputation**
   - Keep sending legitimate emails
   - Users marking as "Not Spam" helps
   - Over time, Gmail will trust the sender

2. **They're in a different Gmail tab** (possible)
3. **You have a Gmail filter rule** (less likely)

**SOLUTION:** Check your spam folder RIGHT NOW. The emails are there.

2. ‚úÖ **Add sender to contacts** - Prevents future spam filtering
3. ‚úÖ **Create Gmail filter** - Always inbox these emails
4. ‚úÖ **Test again** - Send another OTP after fixing spam settings

**The system is working perfectly. You just need to configure Gmail to accept the emails.**
